            <h2>Automated Ledger Extraction</h2>
            <div class='pubsec section group'>
                
                My client is undergoing a Class Action Lawsuit that requires me to analyze payment histories for nearly 10,000 customer accounts.  This shouldn't be too difficult - Just query the database for payment histories and get to work! <br>

                <br>...<i>But... I cannot access the database!</i> <br> <br>

                So, I needed to get creative if I wanted to obtain the data in a structured format for processing.  I set to work with what I have:<br><br>

                Each indidual member history can be queried by navigating a GUI, as visualized below.  This process takes approximately 1-2 minutes per member.  Extracting 10k member histories by hand would take two months!<br><br>

                I decided to use PyAutoGUI, and in three weeks, I successfully automated the ledger extraction. (Note, I've never done GUI automation before, so it took a bit of extra time).<br><br>
                
                
                <h3>Hiccups (w/ solutions included):</h3> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> 1. SSS doesn't recognize keyboard input from any python module. <li>1. Copy input (using pyperclip) and paste using a standard "Right Click $->$ paste" </li> </li></li>
                    <li> 2. SSS has inconsistent loading time between menus.  Sometimes, menus load in under a second. Other times, the same menu may take over a minute to load. 
                        <li> 2. Implement a patientlyLocate() function, which intermittently looks for the pixels on screen, allowing me to capitalize on quick load times, while staying robust to incredibly slow loading times. </li> </li>
                    <li> 3. SSS freezes sporadically, causing script to break within 1-5 hours (impeding overnight & weekend extraction).
                        <li> 3. Implement a 2-tiered approach to handle failure. The second tier has higher time cost (but higher success rate) than first tier.:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Tier 1: Try to navigate to main screen, record the failure, and move on to next ledger. </li>
                                <li> Tier 2: If (a) fails, kill the SSS task, log in using another window.  Log out 
                                        of SSS normally, and re-login to SSS, and move on to next ledger. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
                With this implementation, I can extract the member ledgers 24/7 for next-to-no labor cost.  Further, we can expand this extraction as a means to back up the data on a monthly basis.  This way, we can maintain an internal database for in-house analysis.
