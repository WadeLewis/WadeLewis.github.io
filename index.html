<h1>Job Market: Searching for Jobs Relevant to Us</h1>


<h2>Quinn Cabral, Sophia Lee, Wade Lewis</h2>


<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>In today’s job market it is expected that 49% of U.S. undergraduate students will be underemployed following their graduation. This means that nearly half of the new job force will hold job positions that they are overqualified and underpaid for. The increasing rates of college graduates and subsequent competition are a few factors of this problem in the current job market. In order to mitigate this job conflict, we examined the ways in which job search engines can enhance the probability of newly graduates finding their ideal job. Furthermore, our team aimed to quantify subsets of the current job market, in order to determine the key requirements and responsibilities listed in individual job posts that can then be used to build topic models and recommendation systems for eager job seekers. From this analysis of the current job market, we identified California and Texas as the states with the greatest job availability for statistics majors, while eastern states such as New York and Connecticut had the highest-paying positions available for statistic majors. We also concluded that topic modeling and cluster analysis were useful statistical techniques to gain insight of the specific job post data we collected, but using these techniques to make job posting recommendations similar to the Indeed search engine is not sufficient enough to compare with Indeed and other established job search engines.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Many people searching for a job rely on job search engines like Indeed, Monster, and SimplyHired. As users ourselves, we have previously assumed that these search engines are providing us with the most relevant job postings based on filter and search word specifications. In this report, we aim to expand on the exploratory methods for guiding users to job postings based on the content of the job posting descriptions. Using data from Indeed, we were able to build a pipeline that identifies job postings that are similar in content, and compare our recommended posts to the recommended posts that Indeed would offer. Currently, Indeed provides similar job postings based on relevance to a user’s search words and date. We compared the two methods (ours and Indeed’s) based on the number of unique job titles, the distributions of different topics, and overlap between the recommendation methods. In addition, we also conducted exploratory analysis to get an idea of the recent job market for one looking for jobs in the statistics field.</p>


<h3>Data Collection and Web Scraping</h3>
<p>Our job post data came from Indeed.com. By taking data directly from Indeed, we could compare how our machine learning outcomes compared to Indeed’s. Do we recommend similar lists of job posts or are the listed recommendations different? To collect this data we utilized a web scraping extraction pipeline. This was done in 4 steps:
<ol>
<li>Acquire search results and save the raw search results.</li>
<li>Extract job links from search results and save the links to a .txt file.</li>
<li>For each job link, save the job post locally as an html file.</li>
<li>Extract and clean job posting content for analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>We scraped 19,029 job posts, spread across 10 job searches in 10 locations, for an average of ~190 jobs per location/search combination. The data includes job titles, companies, locations, full job description, the proportions of the description that falls under different topics such as text that pertains to a data scientist topic, or text that contains job requirement content. The topics that proportions were calculated for were identified using Topic Modeling.</p>


<h3>Topic Modeling</h3>
<p>To recommend similar jobs, we needed to quantify the content of each job post; to achieve this, we turned to Topic Modeling. Topic modeling is a means of exploring unidentified structures within a set of documents. We want to develop a topic model to help us quantify the contents of each job by assigning a numeric vector describing the contents of the post. We used the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify unobserved topics within the data.</p>
<p>LDA is an unsupervised learning algorithm, so we didn’t know ahead of time what topics would be identified. After topics were identified by the algorithm, we manually added labels based on what we thought the topics meant. We identified the following 9 topics using keywords given by the LDAvis (shown below).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Topic 1 - Finance/Business/Investment<br></li>
<li>Topic 2 - Performing essential tasks, typical work like heavy lifting or basic office tasks<br></li>
<li>Topic 3 - Software engineering, app and system work<br></li>
<li>Topic 4 - Team/product/platform information<br></li>
<li>Topic 5 - Machine learning, data science and analytics<br></li>
<li>Topic 6 - Gender, sexual, religion, equal opportunity<br></li>
<li>Topic 7 - Lab/research/educational work<br></li>
<li>Topic 8 - Supply chain, life insurance, benefits, 401k<br></li>
<li>Topic 9 - Time, salary, job type, experience of applicant<br></li>
</ul>
<p>With these newly identified topics, we were able to continue on to conduct cluster analysis on the job posts and recommend similar jobs based on these topics.</p>


<h3>Cluster Analysis</h3>
<p>In our attempt of recommending job posts of similar content, we needed to cluster the job post data. Clustering is a type of exploratory analysis that allows researchers to identify subparts of the data as well as determine possible similarities and differences between clusters. We chose to cluster job postings using the topics previously identified during topic modeling and learn about how clusters with similar job postings differ in topics. To categorize job postings into clusters we used the k-means clustering algorithm. By utilizing the topic distributions to establish a centroid for each of the eight clusters, the algorithm assigned each job posting to a cluster based on similar topic proportions that had been previously calculated and saved into the topic dataset.</p>
<p>For each of the eight clusters, we calculated what proportions of a cluster contained each topic. If a job searcher chose a posting from this cluster of postings, they could also look to see job postings of similar words and content. With the help of word clouds we were able to see which words/content job postings of each cluster shared. We also looked to see which posts and job titles fell under each cluster.</p>
<p>Only fractions of the postings with the same title name were categorized into this cluster. For example, the second and third clusters both have the title “financial analyst” in their top 5 most frequent job titles, but the second cluster has only 21.96% of the job postings with that title while the third cluster has 57.65% of the job postings with the same title. This indicates that postings of the same title may not hold the same relevance in content. These results also showed that a cluster could have job titles that one would not categorize together, but were similar in content. For example, the fourth cluster consisted of job postings with the titles “ software engineer”, “data scientist”, “marketing analyst”, “business analyst”, “full stack engineer”. We would not have grouped these titles together, but our k-means cluster algorithm grouped posts with these titles together because of similarities in word content, showed in the word cloud below.</p>

<p>Clustering analysis provided us with a look into how our algorithm works in clustering similar job posts, but how does it compare to Indeed’s recommendations in postings?</p>


<h3>Job Recommendation System Results: How our recommendations compare to Indeed</h3>
<p>Sentence.</p>


<h3>Job Market by State</h3>
<p>With our collected data from Indeed, we conducted some exploratory analysis on the job market. These results are specific to the job market during early April of 2018.</p>
<p>Our Indeed data consists of job postings for postions located across 12 states: New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Colorado, Washington, Wisconsin, California, Florida, Georgia, Texas. Out of these 12 states, we identified 6 that were strongly correlated with trends found in our cluster analysis. Therefore, in addition to gaining an understanding of the volume and content of the current job market, through this exploratory analysis we aimed to examine the relationships (if any) between these selected states and job clusters.</p>
<p>California: In addition to being our primary target state for UC Davis graduates, our exploratory analysis found that out of the 12 states we analyzed, California had the most job postings related to cluster 3, which is highly correlated with data analyst positions:</p>
<img src="plot1.png"><img src="plot2.png">
<p>The 3rd custer is also highly correlated with job titles such as "data scientist", "data analyst", "senior data analyst", "business intelligence analyst", and "data engineer". Furthermore, as of June 2018, Indeed.com reported having roughly 13,000 data analyst job postings in California alone, with salaries ranging from $60,000 to $120,000. Out of those 13,000 positions, nearly 40% were located in urban cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and Irvine. It is therefore no surprise that the top employers for this subset of California job postings were Google, Apple, Kaiser Permanente, Teradata, and California State University.</p>
<p>Texas: The observed proportion of clusters 3 through 6 linked the state of Texas with the career emphasis of knowledge engineer:</p>
<img src="plot3.png"><img src="plot4.png">
<p>In addition to the 3rd cluster as previously discussed, the 6th cluster is highly correlated with job titles such as "software engineer", "software developer", "programmer analyst", "java developer", and "business analyst” In relation to the size and availability of jobs for statistic majors in California, Indeed identified over 11,000 knowledge engineer positions available in this large state. Of these 11,000 listed positions, over 60% reside in cities such as Austin, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. Similarly to Pennsylvania, the current average salary for data analyst related positions are roughly $59,000 in the state of Texas.</p>
<p>Connecticut: From extraction of job postings in Connecticut we found that the most common job postings seeking employers with a background in statistics included actuary positions, which are correlated with job cluster 2:</p>
<img src="plot5.png"><img src="plot6.png">
<p>The top 5 job titles in cluster 2 include “financial analyst”, “business analyst”, “senior financial analyst”, “finance analyst”, and “pricing analyst”. In relation to insurance and financial services being the top industries in Connecticut, there was an abundance of postings for actuary and benefits analyst positions in cities such as Stamford and Hartford. The salary estimates for these particular positions in Connecticut range from $85,000 to $135,000, and are offered by institutions such as Prudential and Ezra Penland Actuarial Recruitment. Connecticut is therefore one of the highest-paid regions for static majors out of the states we analyzed.</p>
<p>New York: In the state of New York, financial services are the leading industry. In relation, our exploratory analysis shows that risk data analyst positions are correlated with the state of New York. In fact, 90% of New York’s risk data analyst job postings on Indeed are located in the city of New York where Wallstreet and the Financial District of lower Manhattan are located. Similarly to the results found in our job analysis of Connecticut, the salary range for these risk data analyst postings is $75,000 to $135,000.</p>


<h3>Employee Market by State</h3>
<p>Keeping the 12 states in mind, we addressed the issue of peer competition. Therefore, we used state-level data from the U.S. Department of Education to visualize the concentration and growth of college attainment by state:</p>
<img src="state_grad.png">
<p>From this visualization, we observed that eastern states such as New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey will have the highest concentration of college graduates by 2020. In contrast, while in 2010 Texas had the lowest concentration of college graduates out of these 12 states, by 2020 Texas is projected to have the highest growth of college graduation rates. Peer competition of UC Davis graduates therefore may be highest in states such as New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Texas, depending on the geographic movement and job preferences of graduates in these states.</p>


<h3>Closing Statement</h3>
<p>While our team had aimed to use clustering and topic modeling techniques to enhance the current recommendation systems used by popular job search engines such Indeed and Monster, we found that these techniques were best used for job market analysis. Furthermore, by modeling common job topics through word clouds and other statistical techniques, we were able to identify 8 job clusters from our Indeed data pull. We were then able to use these clusters to quantify and analyze the current job markets of 12 states, which we chose based on outside research that indicated that these areas had plentiful working opportunities for statistics majors. More specifically, we matched cluster patterns of job titles with cluster patterns of these states to determine which specific positions were most available to statistics majors in each state. From this analysis we found that while large states such California and Texas had high densities of available jobs to statistics majors, eastern states such as Connecticut and New York had the highest paying jobs available to statistics majors. Lastly, from analysis of our main Indeed csv file, we determined that %X, Y%, and %Z of these available jobs require a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and ph.D respectively. These statistical practices therefore helped us uncover the current state of the U.S. job market, and it is our hope that eager job seekers can use our analysis to guide and improve their current job searches.</p>
